## Education
### Msc Applied Mathematics
Paris-Saclay University, France

**Engineering Degree**, ENSTA ParisTech, France

**Bsc Applied Mathematics**, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 

## Experience
### Research Internship: Acoustic wave scattering by thin coated penetrable objects and inverse imaging methods
INRIA / CMAP - Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France
Developed code for the solution of a direct scattering problem in the presence of a thin coating
modeled by asymptotic boundary conditions, and for the corresponding inverse problem,
extending the Generalized Linear Sampling Method. Carried out numerical experiments for
the validation of the thin coating modeling and the inverse imaging algorithms.
