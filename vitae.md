## Education
### **Msc Applied Mathematics**, Paris-Saclay University, France
### **Engineering Degree**, ENSTA ParisTech, France
### **Bsc Applied Mathematics**, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 

# Experience
- 2015 May - Aug **Research Internship: Acoustic wave scattering by thin coated penetrable objects and inverse imaging methods**
INRIA / CMAP - Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France
Developed code for the solution of a direct scattering problem in the presence of a thin coating
modeled by asymptotic boundary conditions, and for the corresponding inverse problem,
extending the Generalized Linear Sampling Method. Carried out numerical experiments for
the validation of the thin coating modeling and the inverse imaging algorithms.

- 2013 May - Oct **Undergraduate Research: Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations** 
UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Studied the mathematical theory and implemented some of the most common numerical
schemes for solving ordinary differential equations using Matlab.

- 2012 Jan - Dec **Teaching Assistance: Linear Algebra & Single Variable Calculus**
UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Provided support to students taking the course by preparing and grading lists of exercises, answering questions and giving extra classes.
